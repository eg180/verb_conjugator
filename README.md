## Project 1: French Verb Conjugator/Game

#Sprint 1:

Store one of each family of verbs (-er, -ir, -re) in French.

Create buttons for each of these base verbs.

When each button is clicked, the database will display the present-tense conjugation for that particular verb.

#Sprint 2:
Change the buttons for an input field.

Whatever the user inputs will be checked against the database. If the verb exists, it will display the present tense conjugation on the screen. If it doesn't exist, default text "Sorry, verb not found." will display on the screen.

Each verb should display with buttons for each tense: Present and Imparfait.

When each button is clicked, the text in the conjugation grid will update to the apropriate information.
